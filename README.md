# Big Mart Sales
## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the sales of products in Big Mart stores. The project will utilize a dataset containing historical sales data, along with product and store attributes, to build a predictive model.

## Dataset Description
The Big Mart Sales dataset available on Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of sales data from a fictional retail chain called Big Mart. The dataset is designed for training and testing predictive models to forecast product sales based on various attributes.
### Dataset Details
* Item Identifier: A unique identifier for each product.
* Item Weight: The weight of the product.
* Item Fat Content: The fat content classification of the product (e.g., Low Fat, Regular).
* Item Visibility: The percentage of total display area allocated to the product in the store.
* Item Type: The category to which the product belongs (e.g., Dairy, Meat, Fruits).
* Item MRP: The maximum retail price of the product.
* Outlet Identifier: A unique identifier for each store.
* Outlet Establishment Year: The year in which the store was established.
* Outlet Size: The size of the store (e.g., Small, Medium, High).
* Outlet Location Type: The type of location where the store is situated (e.g., Urban, Rural).
* Outlet Type: The type of outlet format (e.g., Supermarket Type1, Grocery Store).
### Dataset Source
The Big Mart Sales dataset available on Kaggle is typically provided as part of a data science competition or a real-world data challenge. The dataset is created for educational or research purposes and is not derived from actual sales data.
